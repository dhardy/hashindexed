Hash-indexed collection
==============

You could call this a cache, or a kind of set. It is a simple wrapper around
`HashSet` to allow values of type `T` to be stored in a set indexed by some
type `K`, where values of type `K` can be somehow "extracted" from those of
type `T`.

Check documentation on type `HashIndexed` for usage.
